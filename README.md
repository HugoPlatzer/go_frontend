# go_frontend

go_frontend is my attempt at a minimalistic PyQt5-based frontend for the Go board game.

## Features

* Fully themeable (background, board, markers, proportions) via SVG file
* Minimalistic UI

## Installation

On Debian-based systems:
`apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtsvg` should pull in all required dependencies.

On other systems, make sure python3 and pyqt5 (including SVG support) are available.

Start the application with `./main.py`
